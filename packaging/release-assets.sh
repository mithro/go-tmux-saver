# The GitHub Release's assets for one build (mithro/apt-repo-action
# docs/packaging.md, "GitHub Releases"): the .debs of every debs-<suite>-<arch>
# artifact as <suite>_<file>, the extra files given, and SHA256SUMS over them.
#
# Each file is named here the way GitHub will store it, so SHA256SUMS lists the
# names people download. GitHub "renames asset filenames that have special
# characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing periods"
# (REST API docs, "Upload a release asset"); in practice ~ becomes . (an asset
# uploaded as ..._0.17.post5~deb13_amd64.deb is stored as
# ..._0.17.post5.deb13_amd64.deb), while + . _ and - are kept. So every other
# character becomes a dot.
#
# Usage: release-assets.sh <artifacts-dir> <out-dir> [extra-file...]
