// Quote wraps s as ONE tmux double-quoted command-line argument.
//
// RULING R30: tmux's own double-quote syntax is NOT Go's %q, and NOT a
// POSIX shell's either — verified against this tmux (next-3.8) directly via
// control mode: inside "…", tmux EXPANDS "$NAME" (an argument written as
// "'echo' '$HOME'" is typed into the pane as "'echo' '/home/tim'" — tmux
// resolved $HOME itself before send-keys ever ran), and Go-style "\xNN"
// escapes are mangled (an argument written as "esc\x1bhere" is typed as
// "escx1bhere" — tmux doesn't understand \x and just drops the backslash).
// "\"", "\\", "\$", ";", "#{…}", and a raw literal tab all pass through
// tmux's double-quote parsing untouched.
//
// So only backslash, the closing quote, and the dollar sign need escaping
// for tmux itself. A literal newline or carriage return in the argument
// would otherwise end the command line before reaching tmux's own escape
// handling, so those are also escaped, as "\n"/"\r" text (not the control
// bytes) — tmux does understand those in a double-quoted string. Every
// other byte, including a raw ESC, passes through unescaped.
//
// EVERY data-derived argument on a tmux command line must go through Quote,
// including composed targets like "-t <session>:<index>.<pane>": a session
// or window name is arbitrary user text, and tmux treats an unquoted ';' as
// a command separator (a session named `evil;kill-window -t default:0`
// really did run kill-window against a live server before this was
// enforced) and an unquoted space as an argument separator.

// UnvisName reverses the vis(3) encoding tmux applies to session and
// window names at creation time (session_check_name → utf8_stravis with
// VIS_OCTAL|VIS_CSTYLE|VIS_TAB|VIS_NL): stored names carry `\` doubled and
// control characters rendered as \t, \n, \ooo, … — probe-verified on tmux
// 3.5a and next-3.8 (`new-session -s 'a\b'` stores a\\b; has-session
// confirms the stored spelling). Handing a stored name back to
// `new-session -s` / `new-window -n` verbatim would re-encode it (\\ →
// \\\\), so restore decodes first; tmux's own re-encoding then reproduces
// the stored spelling exactly. Raw backslashes are always doubled by the
// encoder, so every backslash in a stored name begins an escape — an
// unrecognised escape is preserved literally as the safe fallback.

// CanonicalMember picks the one session of a tmux session group that

// after the session they were created from), falling back to the lexically
// smallest member so the choice stays deterministic when that session is
// gone. members must be non-empty.
